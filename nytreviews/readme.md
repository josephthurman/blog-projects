# NYTreviews

This folder contains the scripts for a short project analyzing restaurant reviews from the New York Times. The full series of posts discussing this project is available [here](http://www.josephthurman.com/tag/ny-times.html). It contains the following files:

* `review_fetcher.py` - A Python script that queries the NYT API to download restaurant reviews to serve as the raw data for this project.  This script is discussed in [this blog post](http://www.josephthurman.com/nytreviews1.html).

* `clean_reviews.py` - A Python script takes the raw reviews downloaded by the previous script and cleans them into a tidy data set for future analysis.  This script is discussed in [this blog post](http://www.josephthurman.com/nytreviews2.html)

To avoid copyright issues, we include only scripts to analyze the data in this repository, excluding any of the raw data (i.e. actual article text).
