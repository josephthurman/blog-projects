# NYTreviews

This folder contains the scripts for a short project analyzing restaurant reviews from the New York Times. It contains the following files:

* `review_fetcher.py` - A python script that queries the NYT API to download restaurant reviews to serve as the raw data for this project.  This script is discussed in [this blog post](http://www.josephthurman.com/nytreviews1.html).

To avoid copyright issues, we include only scripts to analyze the data in this repository, excluding any of the raw data (i.e. actual article text).
