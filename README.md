# Code From Blog Projects

I have a [blog](http://www.josephthurman.com) where I write about my various interests, including differential geometry, finance, and data science. You can find a lot of the code from those posts here, but with the accompanying blog post stripped away to make it easier to run and modify.

## Content

* `binomial.py` - A simple but flexible implementation of the binomial options pricing method discussed in [these posts](http://www.josephthurman.com/tag/binomial-model.html). The code is taken from the [final post](http://www.josephthurman.com/binomial4.html) in that series.

* 'nytreviews' - A project analyzing restaurant reviews from the New York Times, discussed in [this series](http://www.josephthurman.com/tag/ny-times.html) of posts.
